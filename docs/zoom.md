# How to set up Zoom with Social Stream Ninja Desktop App:

1. **Download the latest version** from https://socialstream.ninja/ (not the Chrome web store version)

2. **Open Social Stream Ninja app** and click "Activate Source" for Zoom

3. **For the URL field**, you have two options:
   - Enter `zoom.com` and manually join your meeting from there
   - Use a direct meeting link (e.g., `https://app.zoom.us/wc/...`) but see note below

4. **Sign in to Zoom** through the SSN app window when prompted
   - **Important**: If you're the meeting host, you may need to log out first and join anonymously to avoid authentication conflicts

5. **Join the meeting** through the SSN interface
   - If prompted to open in desktop app, decline and continue in browser
   - Make the SSN window larger if you can't see the sign in option

6. **Ensure chat is visible** in the Zoom meeting window

7. **Open dock.html** (found under Links and Settings in SSN) to see captured messages

**Key troubleshooting tips:**
- Don't use the regular Zoom desktop app - everything must be done through SSN
- If direct meeting links give you a blank screen, start from zoom.com instead
- If you're having authentication issues as the meeting host, try logging out and joining anonymously
