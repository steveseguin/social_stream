### To add a new language
To add a new langauge, copy `blank.json` and give an appropropriate name.

Update the translation file as desired, and then either submit the file here as a git pull request, or send to Steve on Discord (discord.socialstream.ninja), or email to steve at steve@seguin.email.

Once added, inside the popup.html file, the file name needs to be added to the list of available languages. Steve can do this, or feel free to add it as a pull request.

### Modify an existing translation

Improve or add a translation for an existing langauge by just editing the file. You can do so here on Github, or download and edit locally; send changes to Steve or commit to Github.  Ensure that it's still JSON-friendly once you finish your edits.

### Adding new translation fields

The process.js file is used to automatically re-update the translation files with new fields that might not already be added. This is generally done by Steve on request or after a major update.

You can also add the new fields automatically, but it can be a bit tricky with certain fields.

### Future updates / TO DO

The menu pop up is currently being tranlsated, as well as some donation fields sourced from Twitch, Youtube, and a few other sites.

Translations for the index/dock/tts will be coming at some point.
