# Custom Themes

For anyone who wants to create a custom theme/style/template for their chat stream, you can share them via adding them to this repository (in this folder) as a Pull Request.

## Quick Start

To use a pre-made theme, you have two hosting options:

### 1. Official Hosted Themes
Use themes hosted on the official domain:
```
https://socialstream.ninja/themes/pretty.html?session=YOUR_SESSION_ID
```

### 2. Local Hosting
Run themes from your local file system:
```
file:///C:/path/to/your/theme.html?session=YOUR_SESSION_ID
```

> **Important**:
 - Always append the session parameter correctly, regardless of hosting method.
 - If Local Hosting, you may need to use &server mode if using this with OBS +v31

## Available Themes

### Themed Packages (with documentation)
These themes include readme files, sample photos, and guides:

- [Deuk's Theme](https://socialstream.ninja/themes/deuks_overlay)
- [Windows3.1 Theme](https://socialstream.ninja/themes/Windows3.1)
- [Neutron Theme](https://socialstream.ninja/themes/Neutron)

### Simple Drop-in Themes
Add `?session=XXXXXXX` to these URLs, replacing XXXXXXX with your session ID:

- [Sample Theme](https://socialstream.ninja/sampleoverlay.html)
- [Pretty Theme](https://socialstream.ninja/themes/pretty.html)
- [t3nk3y's Theme](https://socialstream.ninja/themes/t3nk3y/)

### YouTube-CSS compatible Theme Template:
You can use a CSS designed for YouTube with our YouTube-structured overlay page:

- [YouTube-CSS friendly Overlay here](https://socialstream.ninja/septapus)
- [Create a custom style for it with Septapus](https://chatv2.septapus.com/)

## Theme Development Approaches
Make your own custom theme. It's super easy when using an LLM AI service like Claude.ai ðŸ¤–

### Recommended: Modifying the Sample Overlay
- Start with [sampleoverlay.html](https://socialstream.ninja/sampleoverlay.html)
- Benefits:
  - Compact, focused codebase
  - Compatible with AI language models for assistance
  - Contains instructional comments
  - Single-purpose functionality
  - Easier to maintain and debug
  - Clear documentation of available options

### Types of Themed Overlays

1. **IFRAME Overlay Method**
   - Uses IFRAMES and URL parameters to inject styles into the existing dock.html page
   - Example: The `pretty.html` style adds overlay images on top
   - Good for maintaining separation from core code

2. **Built-in Style Options**
   - Use the app's menu settings or OBS stylesheet section
   - Outside the scope of this document

3. **Sample Overlay Modification**
   - Modify the [simple boiler-plate overlay](https://socialstream.ninja/sampleoverlay.html)
   - Best for custom themes with AI assistance
   - For message structure details, see: [Message Structure Documentation](https://socialstream.ninja/landing#message-structure)

4. **YouTube-structured CSS-only mods**
   - You can use a CSS designed for YouTube with our YouTube-structured overlay page
   - The [YouTube-CSS friendly Overlay is here](https://socialstream.ninja/septapus), which contains more information.

> **Warning**: Direct modification of `dock.html` is not recommended due to its complexity and size.

### Theme-less Code-Only Examples

If you want as little code needed, to help you Vibe Code something for Social Stream Ninjafrom scratch, please see the [Bare Template](https://github.com/steveseguin/social_stream/blob/main/baretempate.html). I don't have anything more basic than this, but it should be enough to copy/paste into a half-decent LLM service and get something that works with Social Stream Ninja.

If you're still not having luck with your vibe coding efforts, let me know, however I do not offer help with debugging of code that I did not write.

## Testing Themes

### Basic Testing
- Use the "Trigger a test message" button in the app menu

### Advanced Testing
- Visit the [sample API sandbox page](https://socialstream.ninja/sampleapi.html)
- Enable API support via app menu
- Create custom test messages near the bottom of the page

## OBS Compatibility Notes
### OBS v31 and Iframe Limitations
Starting with OBS v31, there are important considerations for custom themes:

- Cross-origin iframes will not load as browser sources in OBS v31 on PC and Linux (this was already the case for Mac)
- Custom themes using webRTC via VDO.Ninja iframes (hosted on vdo.socialstream.ninja) may be affected

### Solutions and Workarounds
1. **Official Theme Hosting**
   - Submit your custom themes via PR to be hosted on socialstream.ninja
   - Themes hosted on the official domain will work properly with OBS v31
   - Approved PRs to main branch are automatically deployed and available via the website

2. **WebSocket API Alternative**
   - For cases where iframes aren't suitable, use the WebSocket API
   - Enable with the `&server` parameter or such, as the code requires to trigger. You may need to enable it in the extension/menu as well.
   - When using the Standalone app with local server option, use `&localserver&server` to utilize the local WebSocket server
   - May require additional setup if the websocket listening code is not already configured in sample code to be used; see dock.html for reference in that case.

## Contributing

When submitting themes:
1. Include clear documentation
2. Provide setup instructions
3. Add sample screenshots if possible
4. Test thoroughly
